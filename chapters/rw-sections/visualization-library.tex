\section{Vizualization Library} % (fold)
\label{sec:vizualization_library}

\gls{VL}\cite{visualizationLibrary} is an OpenGL library written in C++ with focus on performance and portability. 

It is very a thin layer over OpenGL, and runs in Windows, GNU/Linux and Mac OS X operative systems. It was designed to be fine-grained platform, and is very close to the OpenGL specification. 

Since it is written in C++ which is not a very easy \gls{PL} to use, it is also not a easy platform to use.
This project was abandoned by the author in 2012, and has not received any update or maintenance since then.
