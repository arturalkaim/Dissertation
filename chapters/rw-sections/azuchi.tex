In \cite{fukuda2015}, Tomohiro Fukuda et al, presented a \gls{HD} \gls{VR} system for Historical Architectural and Urban Digital Reconstruction. They used the Azuchi Castle and the surrounding town as case study. 

They have the goal of having a real time rendering system with high accuracy and realism. With that, they face the same problems as we did. In \cite{fukuda2015}, is consider the problem of rendering large sets of objects of different scales in real time. It is also presented the various techniques they used to face this problem.
