\section{Architecture} % (fold)
\label{sec:architecture}
This section presents the architecture of the system we propose as solution.

The system follows the architecture in Figure~\ref{fig:architecture}.

A module in Racket was Build. This module provides a \gls{API} for the users to describe their models in the Racket Programming Language.
This \gls{API} is implemented in C++ using modern OpenGL. Each of these modules is explained in the following sections.

\subsection{Racket API} % (fold)
\label{sub:racket_api}
Since the focus users for this system are architects and designers, which do not have large programming experience, several design decisions have been made taking this into account. The \gls{PL} that is used by the users is the Racket Programming Language. This is a \gls{PL} that was developed emphasizing pedagogy, is well known for being a good for beginners \cite{Findler1997}\cite{Findler2002}.
The racket module was build to allow the users to implement their models in the Racket Programming Language.

\subsection{OpenGL Backend} % (fold)
\label{sub:opengl_backend}
We implemented the API with C++ using modern OpenGL. We use this platform with two main reasons, (1) OpenGL is a cross platform API for graphics, and (2) the previous experience with the platform.
